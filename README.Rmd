RESI is an R package designed to implement the Robust Effect Size Index (RESI, denoted as S) described in Vandekar, Tao, & Blume (2020). The RESI is a versatile effect size measure that can be easily computed and added to common reports (such as summary and ANOVA tables). This package currently supports <code>lm</code>, <code>glm</code>, <code>nls</code>, <code>survreg</code>, <code>coxph</code>, <code>hurdle</code>, <code>zeroinfl</code>, <code>gee</code>, <code>geeglm</code>, <code>lme</code>, and <code>lmerMod</code> models. Nonparametric bootstrapping is used to compute confidence intervals, although the interval performance has not yet been evaluated for the longitudinal models. A Bayesian bootstrap is also available for <code>lm</code> and <code>nls</code> models. In addition to the main <code>resi</code> function, the package also includes a point-estimate-only function (<code>resi_pe</code>), conversions from S to other common effect size measures and vice versa, print methods, plot methods, summary methods, and Anova/anova methods. A more detailed vignette is being written.

If you would like to contribute to the package, please branch off of our [GitHub](https://github.com/statimagcoll/RESI) and submit a pull request describing the contribution.
